**An implementation of Generative Adversarial Network for image generation (language: Python)**

This model utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate images. Specifically, the generation of defective computer chips (scratches) to increase the training data of scratch detection software, improving the accuracy of such software to detect scratches for quality assurance in the manufacturing industry.
